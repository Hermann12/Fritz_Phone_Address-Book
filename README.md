# Fritz_Phone_Address-Book
This GUI can show the content of an XML export file from AVM Fritz!Box.
Names could be searched. With double click or return-key the selected contact will be shown.


The phone book from the AVM router and the address book from smartphone are not easy to sychronize. 
The idea is to develop a python script or tkinter / sqlite app to make the transfer via xml easy.
