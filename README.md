# Fritz_Phone_Address-Book
This GUI can show the content of an XML export file from AVM Fritz!Box.
Names in the listbox can searched. With double click or return-key the selected contact (name, numbers) will be shown on the right.

The phone book from the AVM router and the address book from smartphone are not easy to sychronize. 
The idea is to develop a python script or tkinter / sqlite app to make the transfer via xml easy.
