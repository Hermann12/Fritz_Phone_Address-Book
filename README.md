# Phone-Book Reader
This GUI can show the content of an XML export file from a AVM Fritz!Box.
Names in the listbox can searched. With double click or return-key the selected contact (name, numbers) will be shown on the right.

Note:
(AVM is the name of a famous German company. Fritz!Box is a product name of the routers and a licensed name 
-> This open source code and page have nothing to do with this company!)

Ideas for the future:
- show multiple numers in same category
- import Fritz!Fon xml export file from smart phone.
- add e-mail
- add passport photo
